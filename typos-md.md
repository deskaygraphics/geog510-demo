# Geospatial Data Exploration and Image Segmentation with GeoAi

## Introduction

GeoAI combines geospatial data and artificial intelligence to improve decision-making process. Using models such as the **Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)**, researchers can automate feature extraction from remote sensing images.

### Key components of GeoAI

- **Deep learning models** for classification and detection
- **Remote sensing data** from satellites and drones
- **Big data processing** with cloud computing solutions


## Image Segmentation using SAMGeo

Segmentation of images helps in object identification, boundary detection, and landcover classification. SAMGeo, a package developed for geospatial applications, enables users to segment high-resolution images accurately.

**Steps to use SAMGeo:**

1. Load remote sensing imagery
2. Apply Segment Anything Model
3. Extract features and perform post-processing
4. Visualize results using `leafmap`

## Conclusion

GeoAi offers immense potential for enhancing geospatial analysis and environmental monitoring. As technology continues to develop, the fusion of AI and geospatial data will lead to more accurate and efficient solutions.
